# ugly-vuejs-boilerplate
An ugly boilerplate for VueJs 3 (WIP)

This was made for the sole purpose of getting to know Vue

A very simple VueJs project with a few custom Ui components (modal, toaster, input, icons ..).
Using VueRouter and Vuex Store
Axios for moked api


Might get some updates in the future like working examples of exception handling, pagination, more mocked service actions and more store integration.
